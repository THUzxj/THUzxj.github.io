Hi, my name is Xingjian Zhang (张行健). I am a master's student in [Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace](https://www.insc.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Long Wang](https://longwang1.github.io/). Before that, I received my Bachelor degree from [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/), Tsinghua University in 2022.

As a member of [REASONS Lab](https://reasons-lab.github.io/), my research interests include reliability, performance and security of cloud computing systems. To achieve these goals, I am working on the machine learning-based SRE methods (AIOps), and data-driven resource schedule algorithms.
