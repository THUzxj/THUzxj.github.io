We investigated the issue of KPI selection in multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) and point out the necessity of it for practical anomaly detection.\n2. We investigated the performance loss issue of multivariate TSAD models based on Autoencoders when they are applied to real-world cloud systems, in particular when there are a large number of KPIs.\n3. We propose fKPISelect, a fault-injection-based automated KPI selection mechanism to solve the gap between existing models and practical anomaly detection tasks."},{"name":"Modeling Composition of Cloud Services with Complex Dependencies for Availability Assessment","publisher":"DSN 2022 fast abstract","releaseDate":"2022","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9833630","summary":"We propose a modeling technology to represent heterogeneous dependencies of cloud services through Bayesian Network to assess the availability of cloud services."}],"work":[{"name":"RDMA group in ByteDance","position":"Research Intern","url":"https://www.bytedance.com/en/","startDate":"2023-07-01","endDate":"2023-10-01","summary":"Work for the reliability engineering system for RDMA systems.","highlights":["Design, implement, and deploy fault component localization algorithms of RDMA system based on mining monitoring data.","Design and implement the system to collect, aggregate, and analyze the huge amount of fine-grained monitoring data of RDMA systems with large model training workloads.","Develop the next-generation monitoring platform of the RDMA system."]},{"name":"Network group in China Telecom Tianyi Cloud","position":"Research Intern","url":"https://www.ctclouds.com/","startDate":"2023-03-01","endDate":"2023-07-01","summary":"Do research on anomaly detection of monitored."},{"name":"Charging service group in Nio","position":"Software Development Intern","url":"https://www.nio.com/","startDate":"2021-09-01","endDate":"2022-09-01","summary":"Design and develop the backend and frontend web services for Nio's car charging service APP."},{"name":"Network group in Kwai/Kuaishou Technology","position":"Software Development Intern","startDate":"2021-07-01","endDate":"2021-09-01","summary":"Develop the monitoring system based on Pingmesh for network infrastructure."}],"education":[{"institution":"Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","location":"Beijing, China","url":"https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/","area":"Cloud Computing and Network","studyType":"Master","startDate":"2022-09-01","endDate":"2025-07-01"},{"institution":"Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","location":"Beijing, China","url":"https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/","area":"Computer Science and Tecchnology","studyType":"Bachelor","startDate":"2018-09-01","endDate":"2022-07-01","score":"GPA: 3.7/4.0"}],"awards":[{"title":"Outstanding graduates","date":"2022","awarder":"Department of CST, Tsinghua University"}],"projects":[{"name":"Automatic Creation and Operation of Experimental Cloud Systems","summary":"Quantum computing is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation.
