      "publisher": "NSDI 2025",
      "releaseDate": "2025",
      "summary": "Large-scale distributed model training requires simultaneous training on up to thousands of machines. Faulty machine detection is critical when an unexpected fault occurs in a machine. From our experience, a training task can encounter two faults per day on average, possibly leading to a halt for hours. To address the drawbacks of the time-consuming and labor-intensive manual scrutiny, we propose Minder, an automatic faulty machine detector for distributed training tasks. The key idea of Minder is to automatically and efficiently detect faulty distinctive monitoring metric patterns, which could last for a period before the entire training task comes to a halt. Minder has been deployed in a production environment for over nine months, monitoring daily distributed training tasks where each involves up to thousands of machines. In our real-world fault detection scenarios, Minder can accurately and efficiently react to faults within 3.6 seconds on average, with a precision of 0.904 and F1-score of 0.893."

      "summary": "1. We investigated the issue of KPI selection in multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) and point out the necessity of it for practical anomaly detection.\n2. We investigated the performance loss issue of multivariate TSAD models based on Autoencoders when they are applied to real-world cloud systems, in particular when there are a large number of KPIs.\n3. We propose fKPISelect, a fault-injection-based automated KPI selection mechanism to solve the gap between existing models and practical anomaly detection tasks."
